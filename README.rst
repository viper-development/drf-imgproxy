drf-imgproxy

Serialize Django's ImageField into `imgproxy
<https://github.com/imgproxy/imgproxy>`_ URLs for your Django REST
Framework APIs to generate thumbnails.

****************
Important Notice
****************

This package only provides the serializer class necessary to translate
your ImageField to signed imgproxy URLs.

It does not provide anything to upload images to your object storage
bucket. We suggest you use another Django storage backend library
that's able to communicate with your object storage solution, in
particular we recommend the following:

* `django-storages <https://github.com/jschneier/django-storages>`_
* `django-minio-storage
  <https://github.com/py-pa/django-minio-storage>`_

   #    storage
   #  - 'gs' for Google Cloud Storage

   IMGPROXY_PROTOCOL = 's3'

   # Set the following to the bucket name that imgproxy uses.
   IMGPROXY_BUCKET_NAME = 'nerv_angel_captures'

   # Set both of the following to the appropiate values of
   # `IMGPROXY_KEY` and `IMGPROXY_SALT` of your imgproxy server.
   IMGPROXY_KEY = 'ThisIsNotASecureKeyAtAll'
